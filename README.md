# Donkey-Kong-Ver3
Donkey Kong Game write in C++
In this exercise, we continue developing the Donkey Kong game, building on the concepts from Exercise 2. The objective is to enhance the game by introducing new features such as super ghosts, the ability to load screens from files, and the ability to save new games. The game is now designed to be more dynamic by allowing the game steps and results to be saved to files and reloaded later for exact playback.
Additionally, super ghosts have been introduced, which can climb ladders and present a more complex challenge for Mario.
